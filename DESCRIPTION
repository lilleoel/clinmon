Description: 
   Every research team have their own script for calculation of hemodynamic indexes. 
   This package makes it possible  to insert a long-format dataframe, and add both 
   periods of interest (trigger-periods), and delete artifacts with deleter-files.
   The calculation methods are based on Czosnyka et al. (1996) <doi:10.1161/01.str.27.10.1829>.
